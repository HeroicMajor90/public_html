				<h1> About myself </h1>
				<span> Hi! My name is Martin and I'm a 21 years old Robotics Engineering Student currently enrolled in UTS and undertaking the <b>31268 Web Systems</b> class.
						I know it's hard for someone to get known through a web page but I'll give you a peek to myself. This are some of the things I love:</span>
				<ul id="mainList">
					<li>
						<h3> Programming </h3>

						<span> I started programming 3 years ago, with my Fundamental of Programming class, in there I learned how to program in C++. After that first approach
							   to the programming world I went crazy with all the possibilities and wanted more, so I thought myself how to program in Python, the language I feel 
						   	   more comfortable programming with.</span>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3> Dancing </h3>

						<span> I've been dancing since I was in middle school, and it's one of the things that I love the most in the world not only because it's my passion but because
						       it saved me.</span>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3> Teaching </h3>

						<span> I love sharing with and helping people, and one of the easiest ways to do both at the same time is teaching; I can share my knowledge while helping the other
						       person solve any problem relating to the discussed topic</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Writing</h3>
						<img src="img/writing.png" alt="An image of a writing I have in my tumblr account"> <!-- Screenshot of one of my writings in my tumblr account -->
						<span> I'm not a great writer nor share my writings and usually I write in spanish, my native language, but I have a tumblr account in which I post some of them once 
							   in a century: <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/blog/maurtiz">maurtiz</a>.</span>
